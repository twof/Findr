# Find.you
## Part of the Make School Summer Academy 3-Day Appathon

#### What is it?
Find.you has two built in sections. Section one uses the FullContact API to gather information and images based on an e-mail. Section two takes a password as an input and then tells you if it was hacked and if it was how many times it was shared. 

#### How do they work?
Both APIs go out in the internet and crawl the web to gather information based on the e-mail and password. 

#### How to use:
Currently, the app works on iPhone 6 devices + iPhone 6 xCode emulators. Open the project folder and click on the "workspace" file instead of the "xcodeproj" file, once xCode opens the project chose your emulator and use the Command + R keys to run the project.
